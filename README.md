# Spotify-Song-Recommender - WebApp

A simple app that recommends five songs along with their spotify links based on a given artists as inputs. [Link to the website]

On the front-end,
- public/index.html contains the content of the webpage
- public/script.js is the javacript that runs when you load the webpage
- public/style.css is the styles for public/index.html

On the back-end,
- your app starts at server.js
- add frameworks and packages in package.json
- safely store app secrets in .env (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
